## Building

To build you need at least `make`, `clang`, `llvm`, and `lld` packages installed. 

Version 15 or later of LLVM/Clang is required for the RV32IC\_Zmmul
architecture we use. Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic) is known to work. Please
see the
[README on the tkey-libs repo](https://github.com/tillitis/tkey-libs)
for detailed information on the currently supported build and development
environment.

## Building using podman

You can also build the libraries with our OCI image
`ghcr.io/tillitis/tkey-builder`. 

The easiest way to build this is if you have `make` installed:

```
make podman
```
